# mkinitcpio-zstd

##### mkinitcpio in the current version 30 does not full support modules compressed in zstd format.
##### A pull request has been approved by the developers and the next version 31 will support decompression of modules in this format without any problems.
##### Source: https://github.com/archlinux/mkinitcpio/pull/43/commits
##### I have been testing this solution since December 2020 and have not found any irregularities. Please report any bugs in this exact repository.

###### NOTE: mkinitcpio-zstd will overwrite the mkinitcpio.conf file and the old one will be saved as mkinitcpio.conf.pacsave - however, I recommend backing up this file before installing the modified mkinitcpio version.

## Selecting the ZSTD module compression level

###### To select the compression level, choose between "normal" and "ultra". 

```
### Selecting the ZSTD module compression level
# If you want to use ZSTD compression,
# first install mkinitcpio-zstd:
# https://gitlab.com/sirlucjan/workbench/tree/master/juliagoda-kernels/depends
# or
# https://github.com/sirlucjan/workbench/tree/master/juliagoda-kernels/depends
# ATTENTION - one of two predefined values should be selected!
# 'ultra' - highest compression ratio
# 'normal' - standard compression ratio
# WARNING: the ultra settings can sometimes
# be counterproductive in both size and speed.
_zstd_module_level='normal'
```
###### The normal flag allows you to select a value between 1 and 19 (the default value zstd offers is 3), while the ultra flag allows you to select a value between 20 and 22. Values other than those suggested (so 19 for the normal flag and 22 for the ultra flag) should be entered here:

```
### Selecting the ZSTD module compression level
	if [ "$_zstd_module_level" = "ultra" ]; then
		echo "Enabling highest ZSTD module compression ratio..."
		scripts/config --set-val CONFIG_MODULE_COMPRESS_ZSTD_LEVEL 19
		scripts/config --enable CONFIG_MODULE_COMPRESS_ZSTD_ULTRA
		scripts/config --set-val CONFIG_MODULE_COMPRESS_ZSTD_LEVEL_ULTRA 22
	elif [ "$_zstd_module_level" = "normal" ]; then
		echo "Enabling standard ZSTD module compression ratio..."
		scripts/config --set-val CONFIG_MODULE_COMPRESS_ZSTD_LEVEL 19
		scripts/config --disable CONFIG_MODULE_COMPRESS_ZSTD_ULTRA
	else
		if [ -n "$_zstd_module_level" ]; then
			error "The value $_zstd_module_level is invalid. Choose the correct one again."
			error "Selecting the ZSTD module compression level failed!"
		else
			error "The value is empty. Choose the correct one again."
			error "Selecting the ZSTD module compression level failed!"
		fi
		exit
	fi
```

###### Entering any values other than "normal" and "ultra" as well as leaving the checkbox empty will immediately abort the compilation. 

###### It is worth mentioning once again that the ultra flag does not guarantee that you will build significantly smaller modules - on the contrary, you may achieve the counterproductive effect.
