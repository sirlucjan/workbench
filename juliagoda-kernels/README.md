# Fork of linux-lucjan. Use at your own risk.
###### HP G62 with AMD Athlon II P340 optimized.

###### Some patches for BFQ/block-stable conflict with patches for BFQ-dev/block-mainline.

###### To use juliagoda-kernels smoothly apply ll-reverts before linux-lucjan patch. Otherwise the kernel will not compile.

* [ll-reverts](https://github.com/sirlucjan/kernel-patches/tree/master/5.10-dev/ll-reverts) / [ll-reverts](https://gitlab.com/sirlucjan/kernel-patches/tree/master/5.10-dev/ll-reverts) - specific patches authored by Piotr Gorski

# Enable bfq

~~For now, you can use `sudo tee /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler <<< bfq` to enable "bfq".~~

~~You can also add this to file `60-schedulers.rules`:~~

```
# Non-rotational disks
ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]", ATTR{queue/rotational}=="0", ATTR{queue/scheduler}="bfq"
# Rotational disks
ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]", ATTR{queue/rotational}=="1", ATTR{queue/scheduler}="bfq"
```

~~and run a command `sudo udevadm control --reload && sudo udevadm trigger`~~

For now, bfq is enabled by default! [(since 5.0-lucjan-ll1-rc1.patch and LL-elevator-set-default-scheduler-to-bfq-for-blk-mq.patch)](https://github.com/sirlucjan/kernel-patches/blob/master/5.0/ll-patches/0002-LL-elevator-set-default-scheduler-to-bfq-for-blk-mq.patch)

# Enable zstd compressed modules

###### To build a kernel with modules compressed in zstd format, insert any character here (it can be "y", "x" or any other value):

```
### Enable MODULE_COMPRESS_ZSTD
# WARNING Not recommended.
# An experimental solution, still in testing phase.
# Possible compilation and installation errors.
# Leave it unselected.
# However, if you want to test the new solution,
# first install mkinitcpio-zstd:
# https://gitlab.com/sirlucjan/workbench/tree/master/juliagoda-kernels/depends
# or
# https://github.com/sirlucjan/workbench/tree/master/juliagoda-kernels/depends
_zstd_modules=
```
###### Remember that to do this you need to install modified versions of mkinitcpio (mkinitcpio-zstd). To do this, run the following command:

```
cd /some_path/juliagoda-kernels/depends/package_name
makepkg -srci

```

###### NOTE: mkinitcpio-zstd will overwrite the mkinitcpio.conf file and the old one will be saved as mkinitcpio.conf.pacsave - however, I recommend backing up this file before installing the modified mkinitcpio version.
